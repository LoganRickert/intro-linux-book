  <h1><span>Chapter 1 </span>Introduction To Linux</h1>

  <p>Linux is a free, open-source operating system. The design of the operating system is based on Unix, an older operating system. A lot of the work that happens on Linux is done from inside of a text-based application called a terminal. It can be challenging to get use to and work with the terminal at first but with a little bit of practice it becomes blazing fast compared to most graphical user interfaces. It's important to be familiar with the terminal because almost all server-based applications and systems do not have a graphical user interface. Files have to be moved around, applications have to be installed, and much more all have to happen from within the terminal.</p>

  <!-- I would love to put in a reference for how to open up a terminal but using putty would have to be a section all for itself lol and starting a terminal inside of Linux varies from distro to distro. --> 

  <h2>Manual</h2>

  <p>The most important command in this book is the <span class="code-inline">man</span> command. Man is short for "manual" and can be used to display information about almost any command. The syntax for man is <span class="code-inline">man &lt;command name&gt;</span>. An example would be <span class="code-inline">man ls</span>. Throughout this book are quick reference sections for some of the commands, the one for man can be seen below.</p>

  <div class="man-entry">
  	<div class="man">Manual #1.1</div>
  	<div class="cmd">MAN</div>
  	<div class="cmd-sub">Command</div>
  	<div class="desc"><span>Description</span><p>Formats and displays the on-line manual pages.</p></div>
  </div>

  <p>One of the nicest features about man is that it displays the arguments and flags for a command with a description for each. An argument is extra information you pass to a command, such as the name of a file. A flag is an option that you want to enable or disable with the command, such as reversing the order of the output.</p>
