  <h1><span>Chapter 1 </span>Introduction To Linux</h1>

  <p>Linux is a free, open-source operating system. The design of the operating system is based on Unix, an older operating system. A lot of the work that happens on Linux is done from inside of a text-based application called a terminal. It can be challenging to get use to and work with the terminal at first but with a little bit of practice it becomes blazing fast compared to most graphical user interfaces. It's important to be familiar with the terminal because almost all server-based applications and systems do not have a graphical user interface. Files have to be moved around, applications have to be installed, and much more all have to happen from within the terminal.</p>

  <h2>Manual</h2>

  <p>The most important command in this book to know is the <span class="code-inline">man</span> command. Man is short for "manual" and can be used to display all kinds of information about almost any command available in the terminal. The syntax for man is: <span class="code-inline">man &lt;command name&gt;</span>. An example would be: <span class="code-inline">man ls</span>.</p>
