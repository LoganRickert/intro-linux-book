  <h1><span>Chapter 2 </span>Navigating The Filesystem</h1>

  <p>Navigating the filesystem in Linux can seem frustrating and tedious at first but with a little bit of practice it will become seemingly amazing.</p>

  <h2>Linux Verses Windows Naming Differences</h2>

  <p>Before talking about any commands, it's important to breifly touch on the differences between the Linux and Windows file structure. In Windows, it's common to see paths starting with <span class="code-inline">C:\</span>. Windows assigns a different letter to each drive. In figure 1, there are 4 drives, so 4 letters are listed.</p>

  <div class="img-figure"><img src="ch2-windowsfiles.jpg"><div>Figure 1. My Windows filesystems has a C drive, D drive, E drive and G drive.</div></div>

  <p>If I navigate to <span class="code-inline">G:\npm\introlinux</span> in the explorer, a list of files in that directory are shown. The files can be seen in figure 2. Navigating around the file system in a Linux terminal is very simliar, except that clicking with the mouse isn't available.</p>

  <div class="img-figure"><img src="ch2-windowsnpmlist.jpg"><div>Figure 2. The contents of G:\npm\introlinux on my Windows computer.</div></div>

  <p>In Linux, everything starts with a <span class="code-inline">/</span> and doesn't have a concept of 'drives'. My home directory on Linux is: <span class="code-inline">/home/logan</span>. In contrast, my home directory on Windows is: <span class="code-inline">C:\Users\Logan</span>.</p>

  <p>It's important to point out two important vocabular terms that you probably know but have never really thought about: <span class="code-inline">File</span> and <span class="code-inline">Folder</span>. A <span class="code-inline">File</span> contains information and a <span class="code-inline">Folder</span> contains a list of filenames and folders. If you look back at Figure 2, the listing <span class="code-inline">magicbook.json</span> is really just a pointer to a file associated with the name "magicbook.json" that contains some data. That data could be anything, from text to an application.</p>

  <h2>Listing Files In Linux</h2>

  <p>When a new terminal is opened, it defaults to the <span class="code-inline">/home/yourusername</span> directory. My username on Linux is logan, so my path would look like the following: <span class="code-inline">/home/logan</span>. To list the files in the current directory, the following command can be ran: <span class="code-inline">ls</span>.</p>

  <div class="man-entry">
  	<div class="man">Manual #2.1</div>
  	<div class="cmd">LS</div>
  	<div class="cmd-sub">Command</div>
  	<div class="desc"><span>Description</span><p>List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default).</p></div>
  	<div class="flags"><span>Common Flags</span>
  		<ul>
  			<li>l - List extended information about the file</li>
  			<li>a - List all files, including hidden files (files starting with a .</li>
  			<li>h - Show the size of the files in a human readable format.</li>
  			<li>t - Sort by time last modified with the newest file being first.</li>
  		</ul>
  	</div>
  </div>

  <p>The output from the command is shown in the top part of figure 3. Each item in the list is either a file or a directory. It can be hard to tell which is a file and which is a directory. By adding the <span class="code-inline">-l</span> flag, as seen in the middle part of figure 3, the command will print out information about each entry. The <span class="code-inline">d</span> at the start of the listings indicate whether or not the entry is a file or a folder. In this case, <span class="code-inline">layouts</span> and <span class="code-inline">stylesheets</span> are both folders, while <span class="code-inline">magicbook.json</span>  is a file. Often you'll want to list the contents of a directory without having to change your default directory. You can do this by adding the name of the directory after the flag (if one is present).</p>

  <div class="pre-figure">
    <pre>logan:~$ ls
build   fonts   includes  layouts   stylesheets
content   images    javascripts magicbook.json
logan:~$ ls -l

  <h2>Changing Directories</h2>

  <p>Being able to move around the filesystem is important. </p>
