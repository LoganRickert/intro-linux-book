  <h1><span>Chapter 2 </span>Navigating The Filesystem</h1>

  <p>Navigating the filesystem in Linux can seem frustrating and tedious at first but with a little bit of practice it will become seemingly amazing.</p>

  <h2>Linux Versus Windows Naming Differences</h2>

  <p>Before talking about any commands, it's important to breifly touch on the differences between the Linux and Windows file structure. In Windows, it's common to see paths starting with <span class="code-inline">C:\</span>. Windows assigns a different letter to each drive. In figure 2.1, there are 4 drives, so 4 letters are listed.</p>

  <div class="img-figure"><img src="ch2-windowsfiles.jpg"><div>Figure 2.1. My Windows filesystems has a C drive, D drive, E drive and G drive.</div></div>

  <p>If I navigate to <span class="code-inline">G:\npm\introlinux</span> in the explorer, a list of files in that directory are shown. The files can be seen in figure 2.2. Navigating around the file system in a Linux terminal is very simliar, except that clicking with the mouse isn't available.</p>

  <div class="img-figure"><img src="ch2-windowsnpmlist.jpg"><div>Figure 2.2. The contents of G:\npm\introlinux on my Windows computer.</div></div>

  <p>In Linux, everything starts with a <span class="code-inline">/</span> and doesn't have a concept of 'drives'. My home directory on Linux is: <span class="code-inline">/home/logan</span>. In contrast, my home directory on Windows is: <span class="code-inline">C:\Users\Logan</span>.</p>

  <p>It's important to point out two important vocabular terms that you probably know but have never really thought about: <span class="code-inline">File</span> and <span class="code-inline">Folder</span>. A <span class="code-inline">File</span> contains information and a <span class="code-inline">Folder</span> contains a list of filenames and folders. If you look back at Figure 3.2, the listing <span class="code-inline">magicbook.json</span> is really just a pointer to a file associated with the name "magicbook.json" that contains some data. That data could be anything, from text to an application.</p>

  <h2>Listing Files In Linux</h2>

  <p>When a new terminal is opened, it defaults to the <span class="code-inline">/home/yourusername</span> directory. My username on Linux is logan, so my path would look like the following: <span class="code-inline">/home/logan</span>. To list the files in the current directory, the following command can be ran: <span class="code-inline">ls</span>.</p>

  <div class="man-entry">
  	<div class="man">Manual #2.1</div>
  	<div class="cmd">LS</div>
  	<div class="cmd-sub">Command</div>
  	<div class="desc"><span class="header">Description</span><p>List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default).</p></div>
  	<div class="flags"><span class="header">Common Flags</span>
  		<ul>
  			<li><span>-l</span> - List extended information about the file</li>
  			<li><span>-a</span> - List all files, including hidden files (files starting with a .</li>
  			<li><span>-h</span> - Show the size of the files in a human readable format.</li>
  			<li><span>-t</span> - Sort by time last modified with the newest file being first.</li>
  		</ul>
  	</div>
  </div>

  <p>The output from the command is shown in the top part of figure 2.3. Each item in the list is either a file or a directory. It can be hard to tell which is a file and which is a directory. By adding the <span class="code-inline">-l</span> flag, as seen in the middle part of figure 3, the command will print out information about each entry. The <span class="code-inline">d</span> at the start of the listings indicate whether or not the entry is a file or a folder. In this case, <span class="code-inline">layouts</span> and <span class="code-inline">stylesheets</span> are both folders, while <span class="code-inline">magicbook.json</span>  is a file. Often you'll want to list the contents of a directory without having to change your default directory. You can do this by adding the name of the directory after the flag (if one is present). An example would be <span class="code-inline">ls -l layouts</span>, which is shown at the bottom of figure 2.3.</p>

  <div class="pre-figure">
    <pre>logan:~$ ls
build   fonts   includes  layouts   stylesheets
content   images    javascripts magicbook.json
logan:~$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x  4 logan  logan  128 Mar 12 16:21 layouts
-rw-r--r--  1 logan  logan  569 Mar 12 16:21 magicbook.json
drwxr-xr-x  5 logan  logan  160 Mar 12 16:21 stylesheets
logan:~$ ls -l layouts
total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 logan  logan  290 Mar 12 16:21 html.html
-rw-r--r--  1 logan  logan  213 Mar 12 16:21 pdf.html</pre>

  <h2>Changing Directories</h2>

  <p>Being able to move around the filesystem is important. The desire to run commands local to a directory happens all the time, like with ls. By changing the directory, you can remove the need to append the name of the directories at the start of filename. An example would be <span class="code-inline">ls includes/app/images</span> becomes <span class="code-inline">ls images</span> when you change the directory to the <span class="code-inline">includes/app</span> folder. Changing directories is easy with the <span class="code-inline">cd</span> command. CD, short for change directory, takes 1 argument and will change your current working directory to that argument.</p>

  <div class="man-entry">
    <div class="man">Manual #2.2</div>
    <div class="cmd">CD</div>
    <div class="cmd-sub">Command</div>
    <div class="desc"><span class="header">Description</span><p>Changes the current working directory. Use .. to go back up a directory.</p></div>
  </div>

  <p>If you ever want to come out of a directory, you have to use the special <span class="code-inline">..</span> directory name. The two dots indicate to CD that you want to go back up 1 directory. For example if you were in the directory <span class="code-inline">includes/app/images</span> and wanted to go back to the app directory, you could do <span class="code-inline">cd ..</span>. If you wanted to go back up to the includes directory while in the images directory, you could do <span class="code-inline">cd ../..</span>.</p>

  <h2>Viewing Contents of Files</h2>

  <p>There are two common commands that are used when viewing files on Linux. The first is the <span class="code-inline">cat</span> command. Cat is short for concatenate and is used to print out the contents of a file to the screen. It is commonly used on configuration and text files. The cat command only has 1 required argument, the name of the file to concatenate. An example can be seen in figure 2.4.</p>

  <div class="man-entry">
    <div class="man">Manual #2.3</div>
    <div class="cmd">CAT</div>
    <div class="cmd-sub">Command</div>
    <div class="desc"><span class="header">Description</span><p>Prints out the contents of a file to the screen. Unlimited number of files can be passed in.</p></div>
  </div>

  <div class="pre-figure">
    <pre>logan:~$ cat magicbook.json
{
  "title" : "My Book",
  "destination" : "build/:build",
}</pre>
    <div>Figure 2.4. Example output from the cat command.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The other command is <span class="code-inline">less</span>. It works the same was as cat, except instead of printing out the contents to the terminal, it displays the contents in a more visual fashion. When running the command, only a small part of the contents from the file is shown. The up and down arrow keys can be used to scroll up and down and q can be used to stop viewing the contents. Less can be a lot more useful than cat when trying to very few large files.</p>

  <div class="man-entry">
    <div class="man">Manual #2.4</div>
    <div class="cmd">LESS</div>
    <div class="cmd-sub">Command</div>
    <div class="desc"><span class="header">Description</span><p>A way of quickly viewing larger text files and outputs. Provides access to a lot of vim macros and shortcuts to navigate the text faster, including search functionality.</p></div>
