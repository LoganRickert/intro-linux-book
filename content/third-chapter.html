  <h1><span>Chapter 3 </span>Searching The Filesystem And Blocks Of Texts</h1>

  <h2>Find</h2>

  <p>Find is a great tool to quickly search through a large number of files. Find is provided a directory and the partial name of the files you are looking for. If you want to search for files in the current directory, you can just provide a <span class="code-inline">.</span> as the folder path. Find prints out the path to the file relative to the path passed in. If only part of the filename is known, the unknown part can be replaced with an <span class="code-inline">*</span>. You can view a few examples in figure 3.1.</p>

  <div class="man-entry">
    <div class="man">Manual #3.1</div>
    <div class="cmd">find</div>
    <div class="cmd-sub">Command</div>
    <div class="desc"><span class="header">Description</span><p>Iterates through a folder looking for files that match a specific pattern.</p></div>
    <div class="flags"><span class="header">Common Flags</span>
      <ul>
        <li><span>-name [filename]</span> - Limits search to only files matching this name.</li>
        <li><span>-iname [filename]</span> - Limits search to only files matching this name, case-insensitive.</li>
        <li><span>-not</span> - Finds files that don't match -name pattern..</li>
        <li><span>-type [f | d]</span> - Limits search to just Files or Directories.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The first example is searching for any files ending in ".html" in the current directory. The second example finds any files with the name "chapter" in the name inside of the build directory. The last example searches for any file that does not end with ".svg" in the fonts folder.</p>

  <div class="pre-figure">
    <pre>logan:~$ find . -name "*.html"
./includes/toc.html
./includes/navigation.html
./content/toc.html
./content/second-chapter.html
./layouts/html.html
logan:~$ find build -name "*chapter*"
build/build2/fifth-chapter.html
build/build2/first-chapter.html
build/build2/third-chapter.html
build/build2/fourth-chapter.html
build/build2/second-chapter.html
logan:~$ find fonts -not -name "*.svg"
fonts
fonts/Roboto-Bold.eot
fonts/Roboto-Bold.woff
fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf</pre>

  <h2>Grep</h2>

  <p>Applications can sometimes produce a lot of output. Log files that keep track of all kind of events can be million of lines long and contain all kinds of various information. Most of the time you are only looking for very specific information. Grep is very useful in this situation. It can read through thousands to millions of lines of data and extract only the information that you are looking for. While grep can be used as a stand-alone command a lot of times the output from one command is feed into the grep command. This can be accomplished using the <span class="code-inline">|</span> operator. This means that grep can be used in conjunction with a varitey of commands, from <span class="code-inline">cat</span> to <span class="code-inline">strings</span>.</p>

  <div class="man-entry">
    <div class="man">Manual #3.2</div>
    <div class="cmd">grep</div>
    <div class="cmd-sub">Command</div>
    <div class="desc"><span class="header">Description</span><p>Searches through standard output and finds string that match a given pattern.</p></div>
    <div class="flags"><span class="header">Common Flags</span>
      <ul>
        <li><span>-i</span> - Case-insensitive</li>
        <li><span>-w</span> - Pattern is an entire word, IE: "is" matches "is", but not "wise".</li>
        <li><span>-v</span> - Matches the opposite of the pattern.</li>
        <li><span>-n</span> - Shows the line number where the pattern was matched.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Piping Information</h2>

  <p>The output from the console can be quickly lost. There are quite a few commands that will output a LOT of information and it's very helpful to pass that output to other commands or to save it to a file. The first type of output redirection is <span class="code-inline">&gt;</span>. This will save the output to a new file and overwrite the file if it exists. This example would output the contents of testFile and save it to testFileOutput: <span class="code-inline">cat testFile > testFileOutput</span>. If you don't want the output to overwrite the file but instead to append to it, you can use two &gt; instead, for example: <span class="code-inline">cat testFile &gt;&gt; testFileOutput</span>.</p>

  <div class="man-entry">
    <div class="man">Manual #3.3</div>
    <div class="cmd">&gt;</div>
    <div class="cmd-sub">Command</div>
    <div class="desc"><span class="header">Description</span><p>Saves the output to a file instead of printing it to the terminal. Use 1 &gt; to overwrite the file, use 2 to append to the end of the file.</p></div>
  </div>

  <p>You can also feed a file into a command with the <span class="code-inline">&lt;</span> operator. An example would be <span class="code-inline">cat &lt; testFile</span>. The last command that is very commonly used to redirect output is the <span class="code-inline">|</span> opreator (shift + \). The operator means to take the output from the last command and feed it into the next command instead of printing it out to the console. An example would be <span class="code-inline">cat testFile | grep today</span>.</p>

  <div class="man-entry">
    <div class="man">Manual #3.4</div>
    <div class="cmd">|</div>
    <div class="cmd-sub">Command</div>
    <div class="desc"><span class="header">Description</span><p>Pipes the output from the previous command to the next command instead of outputting to the terminal.</p></div>
